# 6. Setting Up Webpack

Modules have been available in JavaScript through third-party libraries. ECMAScript 6 adds native support for modules to JavaScript. When you compile a modular ECMAScript 6 application to ECMASCript 5, the compiler relies on a third party library to implement modules in ECMAScript 5. [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) and [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) are two popular options, and Babel supports both (and others). We use Webpack in this tutorial. 

In this unit, you add Webpack to your development environment.

## Step 1: Set Up Webpack

1. On the command line, make sure you are in the `es6-tutorial` directory and install the **babel-loader** and **webpack** modules:
   
   	```
   	npm install babel-loader webpack --save-dev
   	```

1. Open **package.json** in your code editor, and add a **webpack** script (right after the **babel** script). The scripts section should now look like this:

    ```
    "scripts": {
        "babel": "babel --presets es2015 js/main.js -o build/main.bundle.js",
	    "start": "http-server",
        "webpack": "webpack"
    },
    ```
    
1. In the `es6-tutorial` directory, create a new file named `webpack.config.js` defined as follows:
     
     ```
     var path = require('path');
     var webpack = require('webpack');
     
     module.exports = {
         entry: './js/main.js',
         output: {
             path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'build'),
             filename: 'main.bundle.js'
         },
         module: {
             loaders: [
                 {
                     test: /\.js$/,
                     loader: 'babel-loader',
                     query: {
                         presets: ['es2015']
                     }
                 }
             ]
         },
         stats: {
             colors: true
         },
         devtool: 'source-map'
     };
     ```

## Step 2: Build Using Webpack

1. On the command line, make sure you are in the **es6-tutorial** directory and type the following command:
  
	```
    npm run webpack
	```
	
	> Webpack uses Babel behind the scenes to compile your application. You can build an application using Webpack even if that application is not using ECMAScript 6 modules. In other words, the **babel** script in package.json is not needed anymore.

1. Open a browser, access [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080), and click the **Calculate** button.
